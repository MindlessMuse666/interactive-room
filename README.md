In this scene, I have customized the interactivity of the objects.
On the scene there is a room, with the environment of which the Player object can interact. Here are the functions I have implemented: 

1. Opening / Closing doors (by pressing "E"). 
2. The ability to pick up items in the room (by pressing "E"), as well as throwing items (by pressing LKM). 
3. Mechanics of interactivity: when aiming at an interactive item, it is highlighted.
